## Price Match - Full Stack
In Project 3, I focused on frontend development by creating and implementing components using React, along with styling them using Tailwind CSS and custom CSS. My responsibilities included designing interactive user interfaces and ensuring visual consistency. Additionally, I played a key role in debugging, troubleshooting issues to enhance the application's performance and overall user experience.
- Developed frontend components using React, combined with Tailwind CSS and custom CSS for styling. This project showcased my ability to build and style interactive user interfaces, integrating modern frontend technologies to enhance user experience.

## Target Application - Full Stack
In Project 2, I was responsible for backend development, starting with converting an Excel sheet containing extensive data on Target T numbers and addresses into a functional database. I then developed an API to retrieve this information based on search queries. Additionally, I used the data to create a Target-themed name tag and contributed significantly to debugging efforts throughout the project.
- Developed a flexible route handler in Express.js to search and retrieve data based on either tNumber or address. Implemented case-insensitive matching for both parameters and ensured robust error handling by returning a 404 status if no matching data was found. This solution demonstrates proficiency in handling dynamic routes and querying data efficiently.

- Styled the displayed data from an API using Tailwind CSS and custom CSS, integrating it into a Target-themed name tag featuring the Target logo. Successfully displayed detailed information including T number, address, city, state, and postal code.

- Debugged and resolved styling issues related to centering elements on the screen. Through systematic testing and analysis, identified the cause of the misalignment and applied fixes to ensure consistent and accurate display of elements.
    - https://github.com/Bright-Verdant/Target-Application/pull/65 

- Engaged in a mentoring session provided by the Coding Bootcamp to discuss and resolve issues with an Express.js API that wasn't functioning as intended. This collaborative review helped identify key improvements and debugging strategies to enhance the API's performance.
    - No pull requests as this was over Zoom

## Pupper Inspiration - Frontend
In Project 1, I implemented data fetching using a fetch request and handled some styling for the application. Additionally, leveraging my understanding of frontend technologies, I took on a mentoring role, serving as a resource for my group members by answering their questions and guiding them to improve their skills and the overall project quality.
- Successfully integrated and displayed data from multiple APIs using DOM manipulation techniques for dynamic content rendering and applied CSS for responsive styling. This work improved both the functionality and aesthetics of the application, ensuring a seamless user experience across devices.

- I developed a modal that allows users to input information. Upon submission, the modal captures the input and outputs the data to the console using console.log. Additionally, if a user clicks outside of the modal, it exits and closes the modal.
